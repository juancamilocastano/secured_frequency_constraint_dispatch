This simulation is done by considering the new ramp rates that I found in this document

The complet ramp up rate constraint was considered (the constraints taken from hakan's course)

-The idea is to see if with this flexibility, the solver doesn't promote charging and discharging ESS at the same time anymore.
	The solver still promote charging and discharging, we need to keep with the relaxed formulation

-Next step would be including the binary variables of electrolyzers
