-In this simulation, the initial and final values of the energy of the battery were set at the same value to check if these boundary conditions
affect the performance of the optimization problem.

-Results show that it does not affect the performance of the optimization problem, but the BESS is not either charge or discharge. 

-Next step:
	-Do it with sun profile to see if batteries charge and discharge
