- I am running the script ScriptUC_buffer_Binary_S2_new.
-This simulation includes the binary constraint of the electrolyzer, the reserve that nuclear power plants can provide, and tie the constraints of the reserve provided by traditional generators.
-This would be the code used in the paper for S2
-If this code does not work, we could try the code with nuclear but without the binary variables of electrolizers
-This code works with the wind profile that is favorable for the simulation.
